/**
 * This is a JSDoc comment. Similar to JavaDoc, it documents a public-facing
 * function for others to use. Most modern editors will show the comment when
 * mousing over this function name. Try it in run-parser.ts!
 *
 * File I/O in TypeScript is "asynchronous", meaning that we can't just
 * read the file and return its contents. You'll learn more about this
 * in class. For now, just leave the "async" and "await" where they are.
 * You shouldn't need to alter them.
 *
 * @param path The path to the file being loaded.
 * @returns a "promise" to produce a 2-d array of cell values
