# Sprint 1: TypeScript CSV

### Task C: Proposing Enhancement

- #### Step 1: Brainstorm on your own.

- #### Step 2: Use an LLM to help expand your perspective.

- #### Step 3: use an LLM to help expand your perspective.

    Include a list of the top 4 enhancements or edge cases you think are most valuable to explore in the next week’s sprint. Label them clearly by category (extensibility vs. functionality), and include whether they came from you, the LLM, or both. Describe these using the User Story format—see below for a definition. 

    Include your notes from above: what were your initial ideas, what did the LLM suggest, and how did the results differ by prompt? What resonated with you, and what didn’t? (3-5 sentences.) 
    I was thinking of the problem of exception of a CSV file: empty, missed row, and NaN data. LLM offer more perspertive from the user(caller) perspective. I think the most important point is about the schema, that the caller can't recognize the type of data. As a caller, I want effectively use the parser, so that auto-schema wrapping is an important function.
    Besides, the escape character is also a problem I found with the help of GPT.
